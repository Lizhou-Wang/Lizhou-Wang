## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Lizhou Wang, a doctoral student in music theory in Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am interested in tonal harmony, musical forms, Schenkerian analysis, computational music analysis, neo-tonal theory, and the history of music theory. I am now working on my dissertation regarding the modal system/techniques in Shostakovich's string quartets. 
## Glad to share some simple programs used in computational music analysis.
